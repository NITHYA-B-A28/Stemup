    <p>Kulhad Pizza is a unique fusion treat, served in a traditional clay pot (kulhad) that adds a rustic, smoky flavor
        to every bite. Filled with layers of soft bread, rich pizza sauce, melted cheese, and a mix of spices and
        veggies, it offers a cozy, oven-baked experience in a compact form. The kulhad locks in heat and enhances the
        aroma, giving a desi twist to the classic pizza. It's perfect for those who love experimenting with traditional
        flavors in a modern way.
        Price: â‚¹99
