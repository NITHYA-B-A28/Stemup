        <p>Special tea is a premium, milk-free brew crafted for those who enjoy a pure and refreshing tea experience.
            Made with high-quality black or green tea leaves and infused with herbs like tulsi, lemongrass, mint, or
            saffron, it delivers a light, aromatic flavor that’s both soothing and revitalizing. With no milk, its
            natural taste shines through—earthy, slightly sweet, and delicately spiced, depending on the ingredients.
            Often chosen for its health benefits, it helps with detoxification, digestion, and mental clarity. Best
            enjoyed with light snacks like dry fruits, roasted nuts, or khakra, this refreshing tea is priced at Rs 70,
            offering a rich taste with a wellness touch.
