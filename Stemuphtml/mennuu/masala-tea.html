    <p>Masala tea is a spiced version of traditional chai, cherished for its bold flavor and health-boosting qualities.
        Made with black tea leaves, milk, water, sugar, and a blend of aromatic spices like ginger, cardamom, cinnamon,
        cloves, and black pepper, it offers a warm, invigorating experience with every sip. The spices not only enhance
        the taste but also aid digestion, boost immunity, and relieve fatigue. Its strong, fragrant, and slightly spicy
        flavor makes it ideal during cold weather or after a tiring day and which only costs Rs 50 Masala tea pairs wonderfully with snacks like
        pakoras, bhajiyas, namak para, or stuffed parathas, making it a flavorful and comforting companion.
