    <p>Paneer Burger is a flavorful twist on the classic, featuring a thick, spiced paneer (cottage cheese) patty that's crispy on the outside and soft inside.
     Served in fresh buns with lettuce, onions, and creamy sauces, it delivers a rich and satisfying bite.
     The combination of Indian spices and soft paneer makes it a favorite for vegetarians craving something hearty.
     It’s both filling and full of flavor, perfect for lunch or a quick snack.
     Price: ₹89 – a tasty fusion of tradition and fast food.
