    <p>Fruit Burger is a refreshing and unique treat, made with layers of fresh, juicy fruits like apple, banana, and pineapple sandwiched between soft, sweetened buns.
     Light cream or flavored yogurt adds a smooth, mildly sweet taste that complements the fruits perfectly.
     It’s a healthy and delightful twist on the traditional burger, ideal for those who enjoy fruity flavors.
     Great as a snack or dessert, it offers a cool, refreshing bite without being too heavy.
     Price: ₹75 – a fun, fruity escape from the usual.
