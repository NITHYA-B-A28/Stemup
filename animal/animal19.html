            The crow is a highly intelligent black bird known for its sharp mind and problem-solving abilities. It
            belongs to the corvid family and is found in many parts of the world. Crows are omnivores, eating everything
            from grains and fruits to small animals and garbage. They are social birds and often seen in groups called
            murders. Crows have a loud, cawing voice and can mimic sounds, including human speech. They are known to use
            tools and even recognize human faces. Crows play an important role in the ecosystem by cleaning up waste and
            controlling pests.
