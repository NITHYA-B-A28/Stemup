         The panda is a gentle, black-and-white bear native to the mountains of central China. It is best known for its round face, big black patches around its eyes, and love for eating bamboo. Pandas are mostly herbivores, and bamboo makes up about 99% of their diet. They are shy and solitary animals, spending most of their day eating and resting. Pandas are considered a symbol of peace and conservation. Due to habitat loss and low birth rates, they have been the focus of many wildlife protection efforts. Their cute appearance makes them loved all around the world.
